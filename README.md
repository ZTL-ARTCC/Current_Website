# ZTL ARTCC Website
This is the main website for the vZTL ARTCC, part of the VATSIM Network.

### Running Locally
#### Pre-requisites
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) - Must be installed and running
* [PHP v8.0.13](https://www.php.net/)
* [Node v8.2.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* _Recommended on UNIX based platforms for managing PHP and Node versions_ [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)

> ðŸ’¡ If you are not on a UNIX based platform (like MacOS or Linux), it is recommended to use a terminal that is compatible with UNIX style commands ([git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), etc.)

#### Setting up
1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ZTL-ARTCC/Current_Website.git
    ```

2.  Change directory into the repository
    ```bash
    cd Current_Website
    ```
    
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

4. Generate the application key
    ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
    ```
   
5. Update the `APP_STORAGE` variable in .env to be correct.
6. Go to https://auth-dev.vatsim.net and log in with the username and password `10000002`/`10000002`.

9. Open the "OAuth clients" tab
10. Click "Add client"
11. Under "Redirect URL", enter `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login`
12. Scroll to the very bottom to see the new created client. The ID will be on the left, and the secret will be in the middle.
13. In .env, set `VATSIM_OAUTH_CLIENT` to the client ID.
14. In .env, set `VATSIM_OAUTH_SECRET` to the client secret.
